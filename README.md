# Ratio

_A small tool for parametric napkin sketches 📝_


**Motivation** ⚡
- even the first CAD tool Sketchpad was meant to be used as a parametric tool
- these features are rarely used during the design of e.g. floor plans
- find the right subset of parametric features for an early architectural sketch
- helps experiment in an early design phase with geometric dependencies and proportions



**Ideas** 💡
- avoid any additional steps for the definition of parametric constraints
- interpret the way a user would draw in a non parametric tool
- tailored towards rectangular shapes 📐
